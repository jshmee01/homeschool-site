    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      In our home, we teach and disciple our children so they will know and love the Word of God, grow in wisdom
      and character, and be equipped to serve Christ with humility and courage in whatever calling He places on their
      lives. We pursue academic excellence not as an end in itself, but as a means of stewardship—preparing our
      children to think clearly, communicate truth, and walk faithfully in a world that needs the Gospel. Our
      homeschooling is an act of worship, done in dependence on the Lord, for His glory and our family’s good.
